				<h1>introduction </h1>
				
				<p> The Mathematics Student is being published since 1933. It is a quarterly periodical and the four numbers of it constitute a single volume. It is published in two parts: numbers 1 and 2 (January to June) as one part and numbers 3 and 4 (July to December) as the second part.</p>
				<br>
				<h1> importance </h1>
				<p>
					Math is a language all its own, meant to express the relationships between the interplay of numbers. And like learning a new language, learning mathematics requires new students to practice each concept individually</p>

				<div class="txt dtl"> The most important thing to understand is that struggling with math is a common occurrence among students and that it should not demotivate a student. Many children end up lacking confidence in themselves and feel like they are not "smart enough" because of their struggle.</div>
